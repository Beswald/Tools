LuaMacros
-------------------------
By using this application and a custom lua script, I created a set of macros that can be launched using a generic (i.e. cheap) usb keypad. I'm only including the scripts I created, you must download LuaMacros from the source below.

- MacroPad.lua - My custom script that takes keypresses, converts them to key combinations, launches programs and runs other scripts.

- KeyLayout.xlsx - Key map for my keypad, this will be different for different keypads. The correspoding key id's will have to change accordingly.

-Scripts folder - Contains various visual basic scripts launched by macro keys. Usually multi step operations or actions that needed file access etc...
